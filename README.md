# Hill-climb
This project contains some implementations of basic searching algorithms coded by me in C++ from the book found in the repository.
Probably the most interesting is a simnulated annealing function which optimizes the parameters (in order to converge as fast as possible) of another simulated annealing function optimizing a simple function.
